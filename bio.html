  <h1>a bio? a brief summary of my last 5yrs? </h1>
  <p>
    my name is corinne mulvey.
    i recently finished my undegrad with a math degree, despite spending a lot of time trying not to study math. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    here are some of the things i did when i was trying not to study math: <br> 
    i studied physics where i did electronics stuff for a big really cold microscope, milled metal, and soldered. i like books, so i became a joint major in comparative literature during this time.
    soldering was not my calling. so, naturally, i switched my major to german and went to germany. <br>
    why german? you might ask. i, too, asked this 4 weeks after i got to germany, at which point i became a math major again.<br>
    i spent about a year in Germany studying and then interning. i returned to the u.s. and got to opportunity 
    to go live and study in kyrgyzstan for the summer of 2025. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    before college i was very fortunate to work on gerrymandering detecting algorithms for electoral redistricitng with people who are very very smart. 
    it showed me that pretty abstract math can directly help improve society. in my mind, that made it worth persuing as a career.
    regretably, i lost sight of this during college. however, that spurred me to do a lot of (not math) things that likely taught me more than more math classes would've.
  <p>
    i like doing math, but i'm equally, if not more, interested in economic development/poverty alleviation, climate, and history.<br> 
    im not sure how i want math to intersect with these interests in my life, but i've thought about ai and machine learning. 
    namely, because ai models are getting good predicitng things (that's what they're trained to do) and
    being able to interpret how trained models predict things might be useful for understanding what relationships affect the evolution of complex systems.  
    knowelege about these relationship might aid more effective solutions to mitigate the bad impacts of very complex systems (e.g. the effects of climate change on quite literally everything).
 </p>
<p> 
  in my free time, i like bikes, looking at trees, and going to new places on my bike to look at trees.<br>
