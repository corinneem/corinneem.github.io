  <h1>a bio? a brief summary of the last 5yrs? </h1>
  <p>
    my name is corinne mulvey. i'm from massachussetts. <br> 
    i recently finished undegrad. i now have a math degree, despite spending a lot of time trying not to study math. 
  </p> 
  <p>
     here are some of the things i did when i was trying not to study math: <br> 
    i studied physics where i did electronics stuff for a big really cold microscope, milled metal, and soldered. i like books, so i became a joint major in comparative literature during this time.
    soldering was not my callng so, i dropped physics and became a german major. naturally, i went to germany. <br>
    why german? you might ask. i also asked this 4 weeks after i got to germany, at which point i became a math major again.<br>
    i spent about a year in germany; first, studying at LMU in munich and then later interning at a education center for asylum seekers in Halle.
    i returned to the U.S. for a few months where i got the opportunity to study and live in Kyrgyzstan in the summer of 2025. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    before college i was very fortunate to be able to work on gerrymandering detecting algorithms for electoral redistricitng with people who are very very smart. 
    they also showed me that math as a career is worth doing because it can tangibly help solve very real problems. i regrettably lost sight of this during my degree. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    i like doing math a lot, but i'm equally, if not more, interested in economic development and poverty allievaiton, water, and history.
    i also am interested in machine learning and ai. specifically because ai models are getting good predicitng things (that's what they're trained to do).
    being able to interpret how trained models predict things might be useful for understanding what relationships affect the evolution of complex systems.  
    maybe this understanding can help us solve or mitigate the impacts of very complex systems (like the effects of climate change on quite literally everything) and make the world less bad for more people.
 </p>
<p> 
  some other things about me. i like bikes, trees and going to new places on my bike, possibly to look at trees.<br>
  duolingo is a competitive sport for me.
