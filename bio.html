  <h1>a bio? </h1>
  <p>
    my name is corinne mulvey.
    i recently finished my undegrad with a math degree. i intened to study math, but after my first year, i decided i would absolutely not study math. despite my best efforts, i did indeed study math. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    here are some of the things i did when i was trying not to study math: <br> 
  </p> 
  <p>
    i studied physics where i did electronics stuff for a big really cold microscope, milled metal, and soldered. 
    soldering was not my calling. so, the logical next step was to switch my major to german and go to germany. <br>
    after 4 weeks in Munich germany, i wondered why i was studying german. at which point i became a math major again.<br>
    i spent about a year in Germany studying and then interning at an education center for asylum seekers. i returned to the U.S. and got to opportunity 
    to live and study in Kyrgyzstan for the summer of 2025. i breifly helped out at a domestic violence shelter (Sezim Crisis Center) in Bishkek with grant search and fundraising. 
    at this time i learned how philanthropic giving works and how it often doesn't work. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    before college i was very fortunate to work on gerrymandering detecting algorithms for electoral redistricitng with people who are very very smart.
    i optimized tree partitioning algorithms and processed census and electoral data, for an open source tool assisting citizen commissions in electoral redistricting.   
    this expreince taught me that i like solving math problems, which proceeded to forgot for the next 5 years. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    
    
 </p>
<p> 
  in my free time, i like bikes, looking at trees, and going to new places on my bike to look at trees.<br>

    mouseY = e.clientY + offsetY;

    currentY += (mouseY - currentY) * speed;
